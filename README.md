# To-Do List Application

This is a simple To-Do List application built using React. It allows users to add tasks, mark them as completed without deleting them, view all tasks, and delete tasks from the list. The application also implements persistent storage using local storage so that tasks are saved even after the page is reloaded.

## Features

- **Add Task**: Users can input a task into a text field and add it to the list by pressing a button or pressing Enter.
- **View Tasks**: All added tasks are displayed in a list format.
- **Mark as Completed**: Tasks can be marked as completed without deleting them. This involves toggling the task's state and applying appropriate styling.
- **Delete Task**: Each task has a delete button that, when clicked, removes the task from the list.
- **Persistent Storage**: Tasks are saved to local storage so that they are not lost on page reload.
